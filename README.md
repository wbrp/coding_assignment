# Coding assignment

This is a simple programming task to gauge your Python coding skills. It is a simplified version of what a programmer would do in a typical day at Webrepublic.

**Estimated effort**: 4 hours

**Test data**: https://www.kaggle.com/satian/exported-google-analytics-data

Test file: Test_external_data.csv 

### Instructions

Write a tool that parses the sample dataset and produces data points to address the following:

- Are all client ids unique?
- Show the 10 most profitable client ids
- Calculate the total revenue generated by all clients with less than 10 sessions
- Who generates the most transactions: the half of the clients with longer sessions or the other half?
- Calculate the revenue generated by the 100 client ids with the most transactions. Is it possible to generate the aggregated average session duration for those same client ids with the given dataset? Why? How about bounce rate?

You have 7 days to send your solution to cesar.desales[at]webrepublic.ch

### Tips

- The hiring manager is convinced good programmers donâ€™t reinvent the wheel
- We would love to be able run the program ourselves and see its output
- Assume your program will undergo code review and will need to be maintained. 
- This is your chance to show us how professionally written code looks like in your view.
- If you believe something is truly broken with the assignment or the dataset please notify cesar.desales[at]webrepublic.ch
